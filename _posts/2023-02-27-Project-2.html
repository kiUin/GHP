<h1> Project 2: The Puzzle Cube </h1>

<h3> Objectives/Goals </h3>

<p> This was one of my very first CAD and 3D printing projects  </p>

<b> Sketches and Planning:</b>

<br>

<img src= "/img/p1-1.png" alt= "project-1-assembly-drawing" width = "500" length = "300" > <br>

<br>

<b> Final Result: </b> 
 <br>

<img src = "/img/bg-p1.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >

<br> 
<video width="500" height="300" autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="/videos/p1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>

  <br>

  <b> What I learned: </b>
    <br>
    - Design for manufactorability (dFm) <br>
    - Properties of plastics for dFm <br>
    - How to use a Fused Deposition Modelling 3D Printer and the software associated with it
