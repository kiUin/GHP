<h1> Project 6: Personalized Wake-Up Alarm That Forces to Wake You Up </h1>

<p> I built this alarm clock as a final project for the ELEGOO super starter kit that I bought.  </p>

<b> Alarm clock features: </b>
<br>
    - NO RTC MODULE (this is the challenge) 
    <br>
    - Very customizable 
    <br>
    - Shows current time (using millis() )
    <br>
    - IR remote controlled 
    <br>
    - Includes LED lights
    <br>
    - Active buzzer that plays 'Despacito' (for jokes)  
    <br>
</p>

<b> What I learned: </b>
    <br>
    - Programming in C++ (Arduino IDE) 
    <br>
    - Schematics
    <br>
    - Circuitry and Circuit Design 
    <br>
</p>

<b> Planning for the design: </b>
