<h1> Project 4: Wood CNC Handheld Puzzle </h1>

<p> This was my first project with a CNC machine.
     I wanted to make it unique. <br> -- Something that will destory boredom...</p>

<p> Our original design was a frying pan shape with a maze at the base. </p>

<p> However, our school 5-axis CNC machine malfunctioned, and we were left with only the 3-axis Shapeoko XL. </p>

<b> Planning: </b>

<br>
<img src = "/img/p2-2.png" alt= "final result" width = "300" length = "300" >

<img src = "/img/p2-3.png" alt= "final result" width = "300" length = "300" >
<br>
<br>

<b> Version 1: </b>
<br>
<img src = "/img/p5-3.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/p2-1.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<br>
<br>

<b> Version 2: </b>
<br>

<img src = "/img/p2-5.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >

<br>
<br>

<b> Version 3: </b>
<br>
<img src = "/img/p5-2.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<br>

<b> CAM: </b>

<br>

<img src = "/img/p2-4.png" alt= "final result" width = "300" length = "300" >

<img src = "/img/p2-6.png" alt= "final result" width = "300" length = "300" >

<img src = "/img/p2-7.png" alt= "final result" width = "300" length = "300" >

<img src = "/img/p2-8.png" alt= "final result" width = "300" length = "300" >

<b> What I learned: </b>
<p> - Managing CAM on Fusion 360 </p>
<p> - The fundamentals of using the CNC </p>
