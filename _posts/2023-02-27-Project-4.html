<h1> Project 4: Wood CNC Handheld Puzzle </h1>

<p> This was my first project with a CNC machine.
     I wanted to make it unique. -- Something that will destory boredom...</p>

<p> Our original design was a frying pan shape with a maze at the base. </p>

<p> However, our school 5-axis CNC machine malfunctioned, and we were left with only the 3-axis Shapeoko 3XL. </p>
