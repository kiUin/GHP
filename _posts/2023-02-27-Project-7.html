<h1> THE FINAL: Amblyopia Solver 5000 Design </h1>  

<p> Amblyopia (“Lazy” Eye) is a common neurodevelopmental deformity that changes the nerve pathways 
    between the retina and the brain, causing impaired vision in one eye 
    and if left untreated, it can lead to permanent vision loss. 
    Today, amblyopia is the most common cause of vision loss in kids, 
    with 3 out of 100 people suffering from it, and I unfortunately am one of those people.</p>

<p> Things to consider when designing: </p>
   
<p> - Power </p>
<p> - Camera angle </p>
<p> - Weight distribution </p>
<p> - The microcontroller</p>
<p> - Vibrator (4mm is best for its size)</p>

<p> Microcontroller: Rasberry Pi Zero 2 W </p>
<p> Camera: 3280 x 2464 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60 and 640x480p90 video </p>
<p> Range of camera: </p>

<p> h-bridge motor connecter</p>

<br>

<b> Not included: </b>
 
<p> Battery (9V) </p>
<p> L298N H-Bridge Motor Driver (to connect the 4mm vibrator) </p>

<b> What I learned: </b>
<p> - Considering factors for designing my glasses: weight, size, power, and even cost</p>

<b> How I can further elevate my project and design: </b>
<br>

<p> - Use FEA on Fusion 360 and simulate weight and stress</p>
