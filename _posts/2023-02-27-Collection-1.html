<h1> An Introduction: My collection </h1>


<p> A showcase of my progression in CAD and technical skills</p>

<br>
<p> I started learning CAD at the beginning of my sophmore year </p>

<p> I come from a non-STEM school, where I am limited in opportunities and resources to achieve my drean. Most terribly,  I have to ask a friend's father to 3D print some objects for me. </p>

<b> A collection of super-mini CAD projects </b>

<p> I started off with the Onshape software, and I started teaching myself CAD whenever I am free.</p>
<p> I began doing practices and CADed objects using a new feature that I learned: </p>

<p> My first few CAD practices: </p>

<h1> Project 1: Creating and Designing a Portable Cornhole Board </h1>

<p> This idea came into fruititon when I noticed my teacher using a broken cornhold board at a tailgate</p>

<p> So I began designing him a better Cornhole board, that fits under regulations for the American Cornhole Association</p>

<img src = "/img/pp1-18.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-19.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-20.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >

<p> It is designed to be portable and save space</p>

<img src = "/img/pp1-12.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-13.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-14.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-15.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-16.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >
<img src = "/img/pp1-17.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >

<b> What I learned: </b> 
<p> Overall, this was a great introduction for learning the engineering process. </p>
<p> - Maximize cost efficiency</p>
<p> - Save space </p>
