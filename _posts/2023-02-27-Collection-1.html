<h1> My collection </h1>


<p> A showcase of my progression in CAD and technical skills</p>

<p> I started learning CAD at the beginning of my sophmore year </p>

<p> I began doing practices and creating CADed objects showcasing one new feature that I learned </p>

<p> Our school 3D printer is always broken. </p>
