<h1> My collection </h1>


<p> A showcase of my progression in CAD and technical skills</p>

<p> I started learning CAD at the beginning of my sophmore year </p>

<p> I began doing practices and creating CADed objects showcasing one new feature that I learned </p>

<p> I come from a non-STEM school, and most terribly, I have to ask a friend's father to 3D print some objects for me. </p>

<p> Our school 3D printer is always broken. </p>


<b> A collection of super-mini CAD projects </b>

<p> I started off with the Onshape software, and I started teaching myself CAD whenever I am free.</p>
<p> I started CAD'ing while trying a new feature in each file</p>

<h1> Project 1: Creating and Designing a Portable Cornhold Board </h1>

<p> I noticed that my teacher was using a broken cornhold board at a party... </p>

<p> So I began designin him a better Cornhole board, that fits under regulations for the American Cornhole Association</p>
