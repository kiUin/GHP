<h3> Project x: Robotics Custom Chassis </h3>

<p> There were several key projects in robotics this year, but the chassis project was the most important longterm.
    This was a project that I led and mainly worked on.  </p>

<b> Our Mission </b> <br>

<p> - We are a junior team with only one year of prior experience in FIRST. </p>

<p> - Our robotics club is very poor and poorly organized. Teams fall apart when members graduate. </p>

<p> - In order to keep 8875 alive for a long time, we decided to inspire future members to think outside the box. </p>

<p> - Therefore, we decided that it was best to start with a perfect foundation: the chassis. </p>

<p> - We created a chassis that excels in longevity and customization with an ease in maintainence. </p>

<p> And that leads us to this project... </p>

<p>This was the report I created that was added to the grant report: </p>
