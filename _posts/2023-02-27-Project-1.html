<h1> Project 1: The Puzzle Cube </h1>

<h3> Objectives/Goals </h3>

<p> This was one of my very first CAD and 3D printing projects  </p>

<p> What I learned: <br>
    -Design for manufactorability (dFm) <br>
    -Properties of plastics for dFm <br>
    -How to use a Fused Deposition Modelling 3D Printer and the software associated with it
</p>

<p> Sketches and Planning:</p>

<b> Project 1 Assembly Drawing </b>

<img src= "/img/p1-1.png" alt= "project-1-assembly-drawing" width = "500" length = "300" > <br>

<br>

<b> Final Result: </b>  <br>

<img src = "/img/bg-p1.png" alt= "final result" width = "500" length = "300" >

<video width="500" height="300" autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="/videos/p1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
